## Background

Computer nut and web enthusist, and have been one since I was about 7 or so. I have been using Linux since the turn of the millennium, and am about to receive my LPI certification. I have been working on both personal servers and small systems for personal use and small companies for a number of years. I have a deep passion for networking, both with server-side maintenance, as well as router configuration. I worked unofficially with Costco's computer repair department as a Linux expert, being brought in to resurrect data from corrupted windows partitions, as well as a technical support liaison for the department. Currently I am in school, working on a bachelors in Computer Science.

This is due to my ability to learn and adapt quickly, a positive outlook and desire for excellence in my work. I have no problems working long, odd hours, or with being tasked with large jobs. All of these positions require direct contact with customers on a daily basis, if not for the entirety of the shift. I love solving puzzles, and often get sent to customers homes in order to repair and reconfigure electronic components.
